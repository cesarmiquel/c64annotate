Once the map is created you will be able to select memory ranges to disassemble and add annotations and comments to the disassembled output. In addition the web-app will automatically label and add documentation information to addresses that have specific meaning to a Commodore 64: for example, VIC 2 register addresses will be replaced with meaningful names.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
